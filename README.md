The exam office of SSN wants to calculate the internal marks of the students. 
For a theory course, three assessments are conducted and the best of the three are averaged as the internal mark. 
The register numbers and names of the students are maintained in a CSV file. 
The marks for the three Continuous Assessment Tests (CAT) are also maintained as CSV files. 
The CSV file uses | as the separator. 
Develop a program using Pandas library to calculate the internal marks of the students for a course and display the marks using visualization.
